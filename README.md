## Why use Jupyter Notebook?

1. Able to see exactly what steps people take to obtain statistical results. 
   - This makes replication much easier!
2. The integration with markdown cells allows for authors to provide explanations and justifications of their steps.
3. GitHub renders most notebook output quite well
4. HTML output allows for easy static sharing, while .ipynb allows for interactive sharing
5. Not only limited to Python - can be used with R as well

## How do I get started using Jupyter Notebook?
You can go to [Jupyter's homepage](https://jupyter.org/install) to follow the installation instructions. OR I would recommend using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to install a GUI that would make life easier.
